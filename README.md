# MastersThesis_StochasticChoice


This ist the data and analysis code associated with the results in my Master's Thesis at the University of St.Gallen, 2017: Non-Deterministic Preferences and Stochastic Choice - An Experimental Study.

The code is written in R, version 3.2.5:

   - "main.R" is the main script file sourcing the other two
   - "functions.R" contains all functions
   - "comparison.R" embodies the model comparions

If you have any questions about the code feel free to contact me on helena.aebersold@student.unisg.ch
